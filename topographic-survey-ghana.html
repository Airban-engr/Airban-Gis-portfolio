      <h1>Topographic Surveying in Ghana – Elevation, Contours & Site Design</h1>
      <p>
        Airban Engineers provides detailed <strong>topographic surveys</strong> for architects, engineers, planners,
        and developers in the <strong>Greater Accra</strong> and <strong>Central</strong> regions of Ghana.
      </p>
      <p>
        We capture ground levels, features, and terrain information needed for site design, grading, drainage,
        infrastructure planning, and construction.

      <h2>What Is a Topographic Survey?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>topographic survey</strong> maps the shape of the land – including slopes, elevations, and key features
        such as buildings, walls, roads, drains, trees, and utilities. It provides a true picture of the site for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architectural and structural design</li>
        <li>Road and drainage design</li>
        <li>Platform and grading design</li>
        <li>Flood and drainage assessment</li>
        <li>Earthworks planning</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Capture in a Topographic Survey</h2>
      <p>Depending on project needs, a topo survey may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ground spot levels and contour lines</li>
        <li>Existing buildings and structures</li>
        <li>Roads, paths, and driveways</li>
        <li>Drains, culverts, and watercourses</li>
        <li>Boundary walls and fences</li>
        <li>Significant trees and landscape features</li>
        <li>Utility features where visible (poles, manholes, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Topographic Survey Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Project Brief:</strong> We discuss your design or planning needs to define what should be captured.</li>
        <li><strong>Field Work:</strong> We visit the site with GNSS or total station equipment to record levels and features.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> We process field observations into a digital model with contours and spot levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan & Digital Outputs:</strong> We prepare a clear topographic plan and can export data for CAD, GIS, or BIM workflows.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h2>Who Benefits from Topographic Surveys?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Architects & Engineers:</strong> For designing buildings, platforms, and infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Developers:</strong> For understanding site constraints before committing to projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Contractors:</strong> For planning earthworks and drainage.</li>
        <li><strong>Landowners:</strong> For understanding slopes and drainage risks on their property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Do you provide digital files for designers?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We can provide outputs in formats suitable for CAD, GIS, or other design tools, depending on your needs.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does a topographic survey take?</h3>
      <p>
        Fieldwork can often be completed in one or a few days, depending on the size and complexity of the site.
        Data processing and plan preparation follow shortly after.
      </p>

      <h3>Can a topographic survey help with drainage design?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Knowing the true levels and slopes is essential for drainage design, flood risk assessment, and
        siting of structures.
