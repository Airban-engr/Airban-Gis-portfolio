<h1>Why You Must Survey Land Before Buying</h1>

<p>Buying land without a survey is one of the biggest causes of disputes,
encroachment, and failed registrations.</p>

<h3>What Documents Don't Tell You</h3>
<p>An indenture confirms ownership — but it does NOT confirm the exact
location or boundaries on the ground.</p>

<h3>What a Certified Survey Confirms</h3>
<ul>
<li>The land exists where it is claimed</li>
<li>No overlap with neighbouring parcels</li>
<li>Accurate size and coordinates</li>
<li>Eligibility for registration</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Airban Engineering Helps</h3>
<p>We carry out high-precision cadastral surveys using GNSS systems tied to
approved national coordinate frameworks, ensuring speed, precision, and acceptance.</p>
