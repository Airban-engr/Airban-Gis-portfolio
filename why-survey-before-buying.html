    <p><strong>If you buy land without a survey</strong>, you’re buying a story — not a verified boundary. In Ghana, “the land is here” is not enough. A proper survey turns claims into coordinates and protects you from expensive surprises.</p>

    <h2>1) Confirm the exact boundaries (not the “approximate” corners)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>People often point to landmarks that move or disappear (trees, footpaths, informal pegs).</li>
      <li>A survey re-establishes corners and checks if the land overlaps a neighbor’s parcel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Detect encroachments before you pay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Walls, buildings, or farms may already extend into the parcel.</li>
      <li>Fixing encroachment after purchase is harder and usually costs more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Avoid buying land with hidden disputes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Many disputes start because two people were sold the same “area” on paper.</li>
      <li>Survey evidence helps you verify what exists on the ground.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Make Lands Commission registration smoother</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cadastral/site plans require accurate measurements and coordinates.</li>
      <li>Wrong dimensions = delays, rework, and extra fees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Know the true size (and pay the right price)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes the “100 x 70” turns into “92 x 63” after measurement.</li>
      <li>A survey ensures you don’t overpay for less land than you were promised.</li>
    </ul>
