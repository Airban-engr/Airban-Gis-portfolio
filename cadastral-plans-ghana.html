      <p>
        Airban Engineers provides accurate, professionally prepared <strong>cadastral plans</strong> and
        <strong>site plans</strong> for land registration, regularisation, and development approvals across
        the <strong>Greater Accra Region</strong> and the <strong>Central Region</strong> of Ghana.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using GNSS-based field surveys and geomatics expertise, we produce plans that clearly show parcel boundaries,
        dimensions, bearings, and coordinates – suitable for <strong>Lands Commission</strong> and local authority processes.

      <h2>What Is a Cadastral Plan?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>cadastral plan</strong> is an official map that shows the boundaries, dimensions, and identifiers of a
        parcel of land. It is used for land registration, documentation, and legal reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Ghana, cadastral plans are essential for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Land title and deed registration</li>
        <li>Land regularisation and documentation</li>
        <li>Resolving boundary-related issues</li>
        <li>Supporting sales, leases, and subdivisions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Is a Site Plan?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>site plan</strong> is a scaled drawing of a specific parcel that shows its shape, size, bearings,
        distances, and relevant nearby features. It is often required when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applying for building permits</li>
        <li>Submitting documents to Lands Commission</li>
        <li>Processing land at the district or municipal assembly</li>
        <li>Preparing architectural or engineering designs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our site plans are produced with clear labelling, scales, north arrows, and coordinate references to avoid confusion.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How long does it take to get a cadastral or site plan?</h3>
      <p>
        Many plans can be completed within a few working days after the site visit, depending on the location,
        accessibility, and complexity of the parcel.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you assist with land that has unclear boundaries?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We can conduct a boundary survey to map the current occupation and compare with available records
        where possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Are your plans accepted for Lands Commission processes?</h3>
      <p>
        Our work is structured to support Lands Commission and district assembly requirements, and we can advise
        you on how to present the plan as part of your documentation.
